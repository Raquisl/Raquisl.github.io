        <p>WiT Wed Dev Project</p>
        <p> If you are interested in my web development project. Simply click on the image to your side to see the
          project in action. I had the absolute pleasure of creating this project as part of a course sponsored by PA
          Women in Tech, an organization that promotes and supports women in technology fields.
          Through this course, I gained valuable insights and knowledge on web development best practices, user
          experience design, and coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a culmination of
          my learning and demonstrates my ability to create a functional and visually appealing website.</p>
        If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential web development project, please don't hesitate to
        reach out to me. I'm always excited to take on new challenges!
