        <p>Mood Board and Wireframes</p>
        <p>When we began this project, our first steps were to create mood boards and wireframes.
          I found this to be particularly challenging because
          I had so many ideas swirling around in my head. <br/>At first,
          I was set on a mushroom-themed page, hoping to incorporate my
          designs into the website. However, as this was a portfolio website, I realized
          that this approach would be counterproductive. So, I took a step back to reassess the
          theme.<br/><br/> Eventually, I settled on a portfolio website with a color scheme inspired by the Portuguese Man o' War
          jellyfish. I drew inspiration from the vibrant colors and stunning photography of <a class="rebecca" href="https://twitter.com/RebeccaRHelm">Rebecca R Helm</a>, who has
          extensively studied this beautiful creature.</p>

        <p>Code Structure</p>
        <p> After deciding on the overall theme for our portfolio website, we dove into the essential theories of user
          interface (UI) and user experience (UX). We wanted to ensure that our website would not only look good, but
          also be intuitive and user-friendly.<br/>
          To achieve this, we delved into the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, which are crucial for crafting an attractive
          and well-organized website. While HTML provides the structure and content of a website, CSS is responsible for
          styling and design. As such, we paid particular attention to the CSS side of things, recognizing that an
          aesthetically pleasing website can significantly enhance the user experience.
          <br/><br/>We learned how to use CSS to create clean, modern designs, and experimented with different layouts and color
          schemes to find the perfect balance between functionality and aesthetics. We also learned about the importance
          of responsive design, ensuring that our website looks great on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

          Overall, by investing time and effort into learning about UI/UX and honing our CSS skills, we were able to
          create a portfolio website that not only showcases our work but also provides an enjoyable and intuitive
          browsing experience for our visitors.</p>

        <p>JavaScript</p>
        <p>
          With the fundamentals of HTML and CSS under our belts, we were ready to dive into the world of JavaScript. As
          the brains behind dynamic and interactive websites, JavaScript was the next logical step in our development
          process.

         <br/> Our first task was to code a carousel, a popular design element used to showcase a series of images or other
          content in a rotating fashion. Despite being a challenging task, we found it to be an enjoyable and rewarding
          experience, as we got to experiment with different coding techniques and learn more about the capabilities of
          JavaScript.

          <br/><br/>While I ultimately decided not to use the carousel on my portfolio website, I did find other creative ways to
          incorporate JavaScript throughout the site. One particular example is the scrolling function that can be found
          in some of the buttons. This adds a level of interactivity and visual interest to the website, making it more
          engaging for users.

          <br/>Overall, our experience with JavaScript was a vital part of our journey towards creating a polished and
          professional portfolio website. By mastering this powerful programming language, we were able to add an extra
          layer of functionality and interactivity to our website, ensuring that it stands out from the crowd. So, go
          ahead and give it a try!</p>

        <p>Final steps</p>
        <p>

          As I approached the final stages of my portfolio website development, I learnt the importance of version
          control. Keeping track of changes and ensuring everything worked smoothly was critical.

          <br/>To accomplish this, I learnt how to create a repository on Github, a popular platform for version control and
          collaboration among developers. This allowed me to keep track of changes, work collaboratively with others,
          and easily deploy my website for the world to see.

          <br/><br/>And now, after two months, I'm thrilled to present my final project to you. I've poured my heart and soul into
          every aspect of this website, from the carefully chosen color schemes and layouts to the interactive elements.

          <br>So, take a moment to scroll around and explore the site. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it.
          Thank you for joining me on this journey, and THANK YOU to the amazing instructors from PA consulting for this
          brilliant oportunity.

          <br/><br/>Also an honorable mention to Joe and Vez for putting up with my silly questions and syntax errors &#128517</p>
